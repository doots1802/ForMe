1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element

Given a binary array nums, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array. Return 0 if there is no such subarray.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: After deleting the number in position 2, [1,1,1] contains 3 numbers with value of 1's.

1) same as finding max no of ones 
2) choose the value of K as 1 and return count-1 as we will remove that 0 

class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i=0,j=0;
        int count=0;
        int k=1;
        while(j<nums.size())
        {
            if(nums[j]==0)
            {
                k--;
            }
            if(k<0)
            {
                if(nums[i]==0)
                {
                    k++;
                }
                i++;
            }
            j++;
            count=max(count,j-i);
        }
         return count-1;
    }
};
